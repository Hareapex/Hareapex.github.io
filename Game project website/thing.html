                <h2>It started with a video i watched</h2>

                <p>The main reason i wanted to start making this game is because of video made by beambuddy about the game called signalis, the game was pyschological horror story which had a great atmossphere and captivating storyline</p>

                <p>The other reason why i wanted to start making this type of game is the video game called Darkwood which is a 2d top down survival horror game, where you try to survive each night by collecting supplies during daytime and hunkering down during the night to survive the horror of the night. What made me really like the game was the lack of jumpscares, i think its a super overused concept and is really boring, Darkwood did something diffrent... They made a great atmossphere that scares the player instead of the classical jumpscare.</p>

                                <p>Darkwood is my main inspiration for how the game is gonna be designed, since the way its made is so unique. The game brings such a terrefying atmossphere espescially for a 2d top down game. </p>

                                <p>The story of Signalis is one of if not my favourite out of all games ive played and really is a terrifying yet beautifully designed and thought out. The 2.5D gameplay mixed with the 2d Anime art in the cutscenes mix wonderfully together.</p>

                                <p>Still wakes the deep has my favourite type of horror game monster designs, which they took insperation form the 1982 movie "THE THING". The cosmic horror type of mutated human monsters is probably the scariest type of monsters there is. </p>
